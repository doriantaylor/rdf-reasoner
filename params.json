{"name":"Rdf-reasoner","tagline":"Creates triples for various entailment regimes of a vocabulary for enabling SPARQL 1.1 Entailment","body":"# rdf-reasoner\r\n\r\nReasons over RDFS/OWL vocabularies and schema.org to generate statements which are entailed based on base RDFS/OWL rules along with vocabulary information. It can also be used to ask specific questions, such as if a given object is consistent with the vocabulary ruleset. This can be used to implement [SPARQL Entailment][] Regimes and [RDF Schema][] entailment.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Entail `rdfs:subClassOf` generating an array of terms which are ancestors of the subject.\r\n* Entail `rdfs:subPropertyOf` generating an array of terms which are ancestors of the subject.\r\n* Inverse `rdfs:subClassOf` entailment, to find descendant classes of the subject term.\r\n* `domainCompatible?` determines if a particular resource is compatible with the domain definition of a given predicate, based on the intersection of entailed subclasses with the property domain.\r\n* `rangeCompatible?` determines if a particular resource is compatible with the range definition of a given predicate, based on the intersection of entailed subclasses or literal types with the property domain.\r\n\r\nDomain and Range entailment include specific rules for schema.org vocabularies.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) (>= 1.9.2)\r\n* [RDF.rb](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf) (>= 1.1)\r\n\r\n## Mailing List\r\n\r\n* <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/>\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* [Gregg Kellogg](http://github.com/gkellogg) - <http://greggkellogg.net/>\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.\r\n* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.\r\n  Before committing, run `git diff --check` to make sure of this.\r\n* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the\r\n  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.\r\n* Don't touch the `.gemspec`, `VERSION` or `AUTHORS` files. If you need to\r\n  change them, do so on your private branch only.\r\n* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding\r\n  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.\r\n* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule\r\n  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an\r\n  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis is free and unencumbered public domain software.
